### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Frontend Developer with over 10 years of experience. I consider myself an organized and responsible person, and I enjoy working in teams to achieve ambitious results.

I had the privilege of being part of highly talented development teams, focused on creating products for digital media. These experiences have provided me with a unique perspective and a deep understanding of the challenges and opportunities in the world of Frontend development.

Currently, I am actively seeking new job opportunities as a Frontend Developer. I am excited about the possibility of joining a dynamic and collaborative team where I can apply my skills and technical knowledge to drive the success of innovative projects.
