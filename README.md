<h2 >Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Paddy</h2>

<h3 >A passionate Frontend Developer from Argentina</h3>


With over 10 years of experience. I consider myself an organized and responsible person, and I enjoy working in teams to achieve ambitious results.

I had the privilege of being part of highly talented development teams, focused on creating products for digital media. These experiences have provided me with a unique perspective and a deep understanding of the challenges and opportunities in the world of Frontend development.
